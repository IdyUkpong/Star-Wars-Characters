## Problem Description:

Create a SPA (Single Page Application) using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It shows all characters from a star wars API (https://swapi.dev/api/people). Read the documentation and implement as follows.

### Process 

1. Display an image for each of the characters. Preferrably a unique image for each but you could also choose to use a dummy image for all of them.

2. Make a HTTP request to the star wars API and use the result from the request to populate your frontend application

- Display a list with the names of each person from the API request.
- On Clicking any name, display the details of that user on the screen, with name, gender, height only

3. Use es6 for all implementations .

4. Make your design pretty and responsive.

5.  Host your application on netlify.
